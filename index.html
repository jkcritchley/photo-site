	<p>About me</p>
	<h3>
	Hi I'James, and I'm a Brighton based Wedding and Portrait Photographer.

	​My wedding style is best described as creative joyful photojournalism. ​I shoot the day candidly to best tell your story with little to no directing for 90% of the day. 
	​
	​ I truly believe there are authentic and meaningful candid MOMENTS happening throughout the day, and it is my job to capture them both naturally and creatively, for you to cherish.
	​​​
	My goal is to always give you unique images that push the art of photography, while not forgetting the tears, laughs, and quivering lips that make your special day uniquely you.
	 As a wedding photographer, I exist to give your memories back...not to simply take photos and say goodbye.
	​no one is going to come over to look through your computer to see your photos.

	But they will get nosy and open an album that is sitting out.
	They will look at the photos on the walls and smile.
